#What is this program?

As the name already says - it's a git account switcher!
It allows someone to switch between the accounts listed in their accounts.json file.

Separating the github portion with the git portion is something I'll be doing next!

------------------
Python is required!
As the python library win32cred is used in the code, the library needs to be installed for the code to work.

#Initial configuration:

```cmd
pip install win32cred
```

The accounts_example.json file needs to be configured (replace the values!) and needs to be renamed to accounts.json!
