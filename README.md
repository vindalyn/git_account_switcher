# What is this program?

As the name already says - it's a git config credentials switcher!
It allows someone to switch between the accounts listed in their accounts.json file.


------------------
Python is required!

The accounts_example.json file needs to be configured (replace the values!) and needs to be renamed to accounts.json!
